When asking for a description, is sometimes never appear (though the transaction finishes)
  This bug is quite strange, because packagekitd DOES update the description signal (checked with pkmon),
  but the lib doesn't catch it, though it catch some others... No idea from where it could come.

After having installed a package, the program segfaults when I want to do a search
  Another strange bug... Gdb says the function id() is the culprit, and the stack
  says it's called with this == 0x01, which is an invalid address. I check that
  I don't call any function on NULL, so I don't see why this does not work.
